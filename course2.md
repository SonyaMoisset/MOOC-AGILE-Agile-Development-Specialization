# Agile Development Specialization
## Running Valuable Design Sprints
### About the Course:
Typically, clients and managers don't want to pay for design (or strategy) but want to rush toward results. Design sprints allow you to meet clients' desire for solutions--to develop sooner--and still adjust based on feedback. But not all sprints are alike. In this course, youâ€™ll learn how to run situation-appropriate sprints, whether it's testing user motivation, interface usability, or solution fit, to avoid waste and deliver value.

We'll show you how to:
- Plan and conduct a design sprint that delivers valuable, actionable insights
- Effectively test motivation and value propositions
- Effectively test user interface (even without working software)
- Focus and drive to actionable conclusions on questions of approach and architecture
